 * Should scores return 403 or 404? Remember that scores/{id} can be reached.
   A method to return 403 isn't provided by ControllerBase so eh...
 * Should scores be created by pushing to scores or leaderboards/{id} or both?
   Same with delete.
 * Check what the AsNoTracking method does and if we need it.
 * Look up if we'll need to handle concurrency shit in database, probably not since we only add and remove.
 * Decide what datatype our value will be. Bytearray?
 * Look into DbContext methods vs DbSet and see which we should use.
